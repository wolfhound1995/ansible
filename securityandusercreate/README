Create a Limited Privilege User: Create a new user with limited privileges specifically 
for Ansible to use. This user will have sudo access to perform necessary tasks.

Configure SSH for the New User: Set up SSH access for the new user by copying 
your SSH public key to the users ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the target hosts.

Update Ansible Configuration: In your Ansible configuration, specify the new user 
as the remote user to connect with when running playbooks. You can set this in 
your ansible.cfg file or directly in your playbooks.

Make sure to replace "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}" with the actual 
path to your SSH public key. This playbook creates a new user named ansibleuser, 
gives them sudo access, copies your SSH public key to their authorized_keys file, and configures the SSH server accordingly.

After setting up the new user, you can use this user's credentials in your Ansible 
configuration (ansible.cfg) or specify it in your playbook using the remote_user parameter.
